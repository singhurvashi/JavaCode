Bubble Sort

 repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
Time Complexity:

    Best Case: O(n) (already sorted array)
    Average Case: O(n²)
    Worst Case: O(n²)

    Explanation:

    Inner Loop: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order.
    Outer Loop: Ensures that the process repeats until the array is sorted.
    Inefficiency: Due to repetitive comparisons and swaps, Bubble Sort is inefficient for large datasets.

    Here’s a blog-style explanation of various sorting algorithms in Java, along with their time complexities and explanations:
Sorting Algorithms in Java with Time Complexity

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science that arranges elements in a specific order, either ascending or descending. Java provides several ways to sort data using different algorithms. Below are some of the most commonly used sorting algorithms with their time complexities and Java implementations.
1. Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
Time Complexity:

    Best Case: O(n) (already sorted array)
    Average Case: O(n²)
    Worst Case: O(n²)

    Inner Loop: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are out of order.
    Outer Loop: Ensures that the process repeats until the array is sorted.
    Inefficiency: Due to repetitive comparisons and swaps, Bubble Sort is inefficient for large datasets.

2. Selection Sort

Selection Sort divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
Time Complexity:

    Best Case: O(n²)
    Average Case: O(n²)
    Worst Case: O(n²)

    Selection: The algorithm finds the smallest element in the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.
Efficiency: Fewer swaps than Bubble Sort but still inefficient for large datasets due to nested loops.

5. Quick Sort

Quick Sort also follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a "pivot" element and partitions the array such that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left and those larger are on the right. Then, it recursively sorts the left and right partitions.

    Average Case: O(n log n)
    Worst Case: O(n²) (when pivot is the smallest or largest element)

Explanation:

    Partitioning: The key operation is the partitioning step, which rearranges the array such that all elements less than the pivot come before it and all elements greater than the pivot come after it.
